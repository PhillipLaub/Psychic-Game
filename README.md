## What the project does

  *  The computer will pick a random letter from the alphabet, the user must press a key to guess which letter the computer chose. 
    If the user guesses the correct letter within 10 attempts, the program alerts a "You win" message.
    If the user does not guess the letter within 10 attempts, the program alerts "You Lose."
    If the user wins or loses, the counter will update, and the program will reset.
    If the user presses a key that is not a letter, the program will tell them to press the correct type of key, also 
    incorrect keys do not count against tries remaining. 

## Why the project is useful

   * The project is useful to teach the use of arrays, structuring multiple files (i.e. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and multiple asset folders)
    Gain familiarity with the use of getElementById, textContent, indexOf, etc.


## How users can get started with the project

   * Start by getting the file format setup properly, pseudo code each small problem that needs to be solved.
    Create your layout with containers for each piece of information in your HTML file.
    Link all of your files, to make sure they are communicating together.
    Write the functionality within your Javascript file. You will need to utilize variables, arrays, loops, and functions.
    Once functional, start styling the page with your CSS file.
